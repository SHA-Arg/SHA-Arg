### Hi there, I'm Sebastian Here√±u üëã

###My work experience was mostly customer service and managing commercial premises in large stores with staff in charge. I got promoted in all jobs and am currently looking to change the course of my working life by wanting to dedicate myself to the technology industry.
I am passionate about computer systems and computers.
I studied programming mostly self-taught but I am currently doing a Technician's Degree in Systems Programming at the UTN.
I characterize myself for being very responsible and working very well in a team.
I am always predisposed to new challenges and to acquire more knowledge that will allow me to develop on this path that I want to start.
